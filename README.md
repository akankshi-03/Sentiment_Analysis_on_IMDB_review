üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The goal is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

By analyzing customer opinions, this project demonstrates how textual data can be transformed into structured insights that help in decision-making for businesses, filmmakers, and recommendation systems.

üìÇ Dataset

Source: IMDB movie reviews dataset
Size: 50,000 reviews (25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing)
Labels:
1 ‚Üí Positive review
0 ‚Üí Negative review

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1.Data Preprocessing
Lowercasing
Removing stopwords, punctuation, and HTML tags
Tokenization
Stemming/Lemmatization
2.Feature Extraction
Bag of Words (BoW)
TF-IDF
Word Embeddings (optional: Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.)
3.Modeling
Traditional ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM
Deep Learning models: LSTM / GRU / CNN (if included)
4.Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix

üöÄ Results

Achieved sentiment classification with high accuracy (exact value depends on model used).
Deep learning models (LSTM/GRU) performed better than traditional ML approaches in handling complex contextual information.

üìä Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:

Data Processing: numpy, pandas
NLP: nltk, re, scikit-learn
Modeling: scikit-learn, tensorflow / keras / pytorch
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-imdb.git
cd sentiment-analysis-imdb

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_on_IMDB_reviews.ipynb
Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and view results.

üìå Future Improvements

Use transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) for better contextual understanding.
Deploy as a web app using Flask/Django or as an API.
Extend to multi-class sentiment analysis (e.g., very positive, neutral, very negative).
